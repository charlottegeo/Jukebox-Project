✔ fix playback issues on display page @done(24-10-21 04:17)
✔ fix issue on search page where you must refresh to see your updated queue (in the case where your song was loaded into display page) @done(24-10-24 08:34)
☐ add all necessary round robin queue-related functions
☐ test round robin with 1 or 2 other people
☐ It seems that the round robin system is broken?
    ☐ From what i can tell, it is rotating between users but playing all the user's songs before switching
    ☐ It should be playing the first song 
    ☐ Ok it is working now? But i want to make sure that the logic is sound
    ☐ Potentially it has something to do with users not having their pages open
✔ Fix spotify api call so the audiofeatures call is only made once a song is loaded into the display page @done(24-11-08 06:04)
✔ make sure queue updates visually when albums and playlists and songs added from links are added @done(24-11-08 07:17)
✔ When page refreshes, show the queue that was there before the refresh @done(24-11-08 07:26)
@high
✔ get username to add to queue (i think i do need socketio session for this) @done(24-10-25 19:12)
☐ make an isAdmin boolean to determine when a user logs in if they are an admin based on if they are in the rtp or eboard groups or if their username is ccyborgg
☐ Only show admin panel if the user is an admin
☐ when a song loads from the queue, load the song info but have a loading animation while waiting for the song to download + load
☐ Add a 1m grace period if a user disconnects before they are removed from the round robin system (not removing their queue, just removing their username from the round robin rotation)
☐ If a user is removed from the round robin system, keep their queue in the system, but remove their username from the round robin rotation
☐ make sure when a user refreshes the page, their queue is still there
☐ Show global queue (accessible to all users?)

@low
☐ admin commands
    ✔ force skip song @done(24-11-01 10:24)
    ☐ pause/play
    ☐ view active users
    ☐ possibly view (not edit) queues?
    ✔ refresh display (in case something breaks? might not need this if you ensure no bugs in queue playback) @done(24-11-01 10:43)
    ☐ adjust volume with SSH (or a simpler/more secure way?)
    ☐ adjust song length limit (hard max length of 10 minutes, no minimum length)
☐ make display page authenticated in some way, separated from the sso on the search page.
☐ ensure that display page login is not added to queue
☐ put the proper functions as auth only (refer to events.py)
☐ add dropdown to search page (and remove the one from display page) to update user color (the color for a given user)
☐ make cat animation update with new color when color is changed
☐ when a song loads from the queue, update the cat animation to reflect the new user's color
☐ if a user whose song is currently playing changes their color, update the cat animation to reflect the new color
☐ Store user color in session so if they refresh the page or leave and come back, their color is still the same
✔ make admin panel a popup or dropdown (or even a sidebar), instead of a separate page? @done(24-11-08 18:11)
☐ make it so you need to click song twice to add to queue
    ☐ highlight selected song when first clicked
    ☐ if the user clicks a different song, highlight that one instead, removing previously selected
    ☐ de-select if the user clicks on something other than the songs
☐ highlight the first song in the next user's queue to indicate that their song is up next
    ☐ if the user re-orders their queue, indicate the new upcoming song
☐ have a grace period of ~10 seconds if a user disconnects before they are removed from the round robin system (keep their queue, just remove username from the round robin rotation system)
☐ add message popup like in your flask version
    ☐ used to indicate that songs are rejected due to invalid link or being over the limit
    ☐ used to show how many songs from a playlist or album were successfully added to the queue
☐ implement vote-to-skip, with the threshold being 1 if there is only 1 user in the queue, or a little over half of the number of users in the queue
    ☐ automatically calls next song if the threshold is met
☐ Add check for song length limit + reject song from being added if it is above the current limit
    ☐ Maybe display the current limit on the search page
☐ On search page, show number of active users (and maybe number of songs in queue)
☐ Add a "times clicked" button just for ella
☐ Show the order in numbers of the user's queue and/or show some way to indicate that you can click + drag the queue to re-order it
☐ Improve UI and fix buttons for mobile devices
☐ "For mobile UI have the add the queue be a toggle so you can only press it once? Just a suggestion."
☐ I noticed that the light/dark mode switcher isn't always visible when the page loads
3Note: When testing round robin with 1 or 2 other people, also get feedback about UI and navigating the page
If one of the other people is an RTP or eboard member, ask them about the admin functions and if anything should be added or removed
